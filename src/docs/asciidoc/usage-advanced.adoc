== Customising queues and messages

PerfTest can create queues using provided queue arguments:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --queue-arguments x-max-length=10

The previous command will create a https://www.rabbitmq.com/maxlength.html[queue with a length limit]
of 10. You can also provide several queue arguments by separating the
key/value pairs with commas:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest \
   --queue-arguments x-max-length=10,x-dead-letter-exchange=some.exchange.name

You can also specify message properties with key/value pairs separated by commas:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest \
   --message-properties priority=5,timestamp=2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00

The supported property keys are: `contentType`, `contentEncoding`,
`deliveryMode`, `priority`, `correlationId`, `replyTo`, `expiration`, `messageId`,
`timestamp`, `type`, `userId`, `appId`, `clusterId`. If some provided
keys do not belong to the previous list, the pairs will be considered
as headers (arbitrary key/value pairs):

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest \
   --message-properties priority=10,header1=value1,header2=value2

You can mimic real messages by specifying their content and
content type. This can be useful when plugging real application
consumers downstream. The content can come from one or several files and
the content-type can be specified:

  bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --consumers 0 \
    --body content1.json,content2.json --body-content-type application/json

== Working with many queues
   
PertTest supports balancing the publishing and the consumption
across a sequence of queues, e.g.:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --queue-pattern 'perf-test-%d' \
   --queue-pattern-from 1 --queue-pattern-to 10 \
   --producers 100 --consumers 100

The previous command would create the `perf-test-1`, `perf-test-2`, ...,
`perf-test-10` queues and spreads the producers and consumers across them.
This way each queue will have 10 consumers and 10 producers sending messages to it.

Load is balanced in a round-robin fashion:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --queue-pattern 'perf-test-%d' \
   --queue-pattern-from 1 --queue-pattern-to 10 \
   --producers 15 --consumers 30

With the previous command, queues from `perf-test-1` to `perf-test-5`
will have 2 producers, and queues from `perf-test-6` to `perf-test-10`
will have only 1 producer. Each queue will have 3 consumers.

Note the `--queue-pattern` value is a
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html[Java printf-style format string].
The queue index is the only argument passed in. The formatting is very closed to C's `printf`.
`--queue-pattern 'perf-test-%03d' --queue-pattern-from 1 --queue-pattern-to 500` would for
instance create queues from `perf-test-001` to `perf-test-500`.

== Simulating High Loads
   

PerfTest can easily run hundreds of connections on a simple desktop machine.
Each producer and consumer use a Java thread and a TCP connection though,
so a PerfTest process can quickly run out of file descriptors, depending
on the OS settings. A simple solution is to use several PerfTest processes,
on the same machine or not. This is especially handy when combined
with the link:#working-with-many-queues[queue sequence] feature.

The following command line launches a first PerfTest process that
creates 500 queues (from `perf-test-1` to `perf-test-500`).
Each queue will have 3 consumers and 1 producer sending messages to it:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --queue-pattern 'perf-test-%d' \
   --queue-pattern-from 1 --queue-pattern-to 500 \
   --producers 500 --consumers 1500

Then the following command line launches a second PerfTest process
that creates 500 queues (from `perf-test-501` to `perf-test-1000`).
Each queue will have 3 consumers and 1 producer sending messages to it:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --queue-pattern 'perf-test-%d' \
  --queue-pattern-from 501 --queue-pattern-to 1000 \
  --producers 500 --consumers 1500

Those 2 processes will simulate 1000 producers and 3000 consumers spread
across 1000 queues.

A PerfTest process can exhaust its file descriptors limit and throw
`java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread`
exceptions. A first way to avoid this is to reduce the number of Java threads
PerfTest uses with the `--heartbeat-sender-threads` option:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --queue-pattern 'perf-test-%d' \
   --queue-pattern-from 1 --queue-pattern-to 1000 \
   --producers 1000 --consumers 3000 --heartbeat-sender-threads 10

By default, each producer and consumer connection uses a dedicated thread
to send heartbeats to the broker, so this is 4000 threads for heartbeats
in the previous sample. Considering producers and consumers always communicate
with the broker by publishing messages or sending acknowledgments, connections
are never idle, so using 10 threads for heartbeats for the 4000 connections
should be enough. Don't hesitate to experiment to come up with the appropriate
`--heartbeat-sender-threads` value for your use case.

Another way to avoid `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread`
exceptions is to tune the number of file descriptors allowed per process
at the OS level, as some distributions use very low limits.
Here the recommendations are the same as for the broker, so you
can refer to our https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html#os-tuning[networking guide].

== Workloads with a Large Number of Clients

A typical connected device workload (a.k.a "IoT workload") involves
many producers and consumers (dozens or hundreds of thousands)
that exchange messages at a low and mostly constant rate, usually a message every few seconds or minutes.
Simulating such workloads requires a different set of settings compared to
the workloads that have higher throughput and a small number of clients. With the appropriate set of flags,
PerfTest can simulate IoT workloads without requiring too many resources.

With an IoT workload, publishers usually don't publish many messages per second,
but rather a message every fixed period of time. This can be achieved by using the `--publishing-interval`
flag instead of the `--rate` one. For example:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --publishing-interval 5

The command above makes the publisher publish a message every 5 seconds.
To simulate a group of consumers, use the `--queue-pattern` flag to simulate many consumers across
many queues:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --queue-pattern 'perf-test-%d' \
   --queue-pattern-from 1 --queue-pattern-to 1000 \
   --producers 1000 --consumers 1000 \
   --heartbeat-sender-threads 10 \
   --publishing-interval 5

To prevent publishers from publishing at roughly the same time and
distribute the rate more evenly, use
the `--producer-random-start-delay` option to add an random
delay before the first published message:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --queue-pattern 'perf-test-%d' \
   --queue-pattern-from 1 --queue-pattern-to 1000 \
   --producers 1000 --consumers 1000 \
   --heartbeat-sender-threads 10 \
   --publishing-interval 5 --producer-random-start-delay 120

With the command above, each publisher will start with a random delay
between 1 and 120 seconds.

When using `--publishing-interval`, PerfTest will use one thread
for scheduling publishing for all 50 producers. So 1000 producers should keep 20 threads busy for
the publishing scheduling. This ratio can be decreased or increased with the
`--producer-scheduler-threads` options depending on the load and the target environment.
Very few threads can be used for very slow publishers:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --queue-pattern 'perf-test-%d' \
   --queue-pattern-from 1 --queue-pattern-to 1000 \
   --producers 1000 --consumers 1000 \
   --heartbeat-sender-threads 10 \
   --publishing-interval 60 --producer-random-start-delay 1800 \
   --producer-scheduler-threads 10

In the example above, 1000 publishers will publish every 60 seconds
with a random start-up delay between 1 second and 15 minutes (1800 seconds). They
will be scheduled by only 10 threads (instead of 20 by default). Such delay
values are suitable for long running tests.

By default, PerfTest uses blocking network socket I/O to communicate with
the broker. This mode works fine for clients in many cases but the RabbitMQ Java client
also supports an https://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html#java-nio[asynchronous I/O mode],
where resources like threads can be easily tuned. The goal here is to use as few
resources as possible to simulate as much load as possible with a single PerfTest instance.
In the slow publisher example above, a handful of threads should be enough
to handle the I/O. That's what the
`--nio-threads` flag is for:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --queue-pattern 'perf-test-%d' \
   --queue-pattern-from 1 --queue-pattern-to 1000 \
   --producers 1000 --consumers 1000 \
   --heartbeat-sender-threads 10 \
   --publishing-interval 60 --producer-random-start-delay 1800 \
   --producer-scheduler-threads 10
   --nio-threads 10

This way PerfTest will use  12 threads for I/O over all the connections.
With the default blocking I/O mode, each producer (or consumer)
uses a thread for the I/O loop, that is 2000 threads to simulate 1000 producers and
1000 consumers. Using NIO in PerfTest can dramatically reduce the resources used
to simulate workloads with a large number of connections with appropriate tuning.

Note that in NIO mode the number of threads used can increase temporarily when connections close
unexpectedly and connection recovery kicks in. This is due to the NIO mode dispatching
connection closing to non-I/O threads to avoid deadlocks. Connection recovery can be disabled
with the `--disable-connection-recovery` flag.


== Running Producers and Consumers on Different Machines

If you run producers and consumers on different machines or even
in different processes, and you want PerfTest to calculate latency,
you need to use the `--use-millis` flag. E.g. for sending messages
from one host:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --producers 1 --consumers 0 \
   --predeclared --routing-key rk --queue q --use-millis

And for consuming messages from another host:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --producers 0 --consumers 1 \
   --predeclared --routing-key rk --queue q --use-millis

Note that as soon as you use `--use-millis`, latency is calculated in
milliseconds instead of microseconds. Note also the different machines should have
their clock synchronised, e.g. by NTP.
If you don't run producers and consumers on different machines or if you don't
want PerfTest to calculate latency, you don't need the `--use-millis` flag.

Why does one need to care about the `--use-millis` flag? PerfTest uses
by default `System.nanoTime()` in messages to calculate latency
between producers and senders. `System.nanoTime()` provides nanosecond precision
but must be used only in the same Java process. So PerfTest can fall back to `System.currentTimeMillis()`,
which provides only milliseconds precision, but is reliable between different machines
as long as their clocks are synchronised.

== TLS Support

PerfTest can use TLS to connect to a node that is
https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html[configured to accept TLS connections].
To enable TLS, simply specify a URI that uses the `amqps` schema:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -h amqps://localhost:5671

By default PerfTest automatically trusts the server
and doesn't present any client certificate (a warning
shows up in the console). In many benchmarking or load testing scenarios this may be sufficient.
If peer verification is necessary, it is possible to use the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#InstallationAndCustomization[appropriate
JVM properties] on the command line to override the default `SSLContext`.
For example, to trust a given server:

 JAVA_OPTS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/server_key.p12 -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=bunnies -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=PKCS12" \
   bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -h amqps://localhost:5671

The previous snippet uses a one-liner to define the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable
while running PerfTest. Please refer to the
https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html[TLS guide] to learn about how to set up RabbitMQ with TLS.
A convenient way to generate a CA and some self-signed certificate/key pairs for development and QA environments
is with https://github.com/michaelklishin/tls-gen/[`tls-gen`].
`tls-gen`'s basic profile is a good starting point. How to run PerfTest with
a certificate/key pair generated by the aforementioned profile:

 JAVA_OPTS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/server_key.p12 -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=bunnies -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=PKCS12 -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/path/to/client_key.p12 -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=bunnies -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStoreType=PKCS12" \
   bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -h amqps://localhost:5671

== Result Reporting in HTML

The `PerfTest HTML extension` are a set of tools
that can help you run automated benchmarks by wrapping around PerfTest. You can provide
benchmark specs, and the tool will take care of running the benchmark,
collecting results and displaying them in an HTML page. Learn more
